The project is a salary management system that incorporates various design patterns to handle different aspects of the system. The main features of the system include a salary raise strategy for employees, a Singleton pattern for managing a manager instance, and a Facade pattern to simplify the process of checking mortgage eligibility for customers.

The system has been divided into different subsystems, each responsible for a specific task. The subsystems include classes for handling bank operations, credit checks, and loan checks, as well as classes for different salary raise strategies, such as promotion, good numbers, and annually.

The Mortgage class acts as a facade, providing a simplified interface for evaluating mortgage eligibility for customers by checking their financial information against the bank, credit, and loan subsystems.

As a member of the project team, I played a crucial role in the development and implementation of the salary management system. My responsibilities revolved around designing and implementing key components of the system, with a particular focus on leveraging C# and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure a robust and maintainable codebase.

Specifically, my contributions included:

Singleton Pattern Implementation: I was involved in implementing the Singleton pattern for the Manager class. My role included ensuring that only one instance of the manager is created and maintaining its global accessibility throughout the application.

Code Reviews and Team Support: Throughout the development process, I contributed to code reviews, providing constructive feedback to improve the quality and maintainability of the code. I also offered support to other team members, fostering a collaborative and cohesive team environment.
